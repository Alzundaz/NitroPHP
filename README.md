# NitroPHP

This is an overide to Symfony framework.

It provide a lots of addition :

- Built in server
- super speed app
- automatic service launching
- modular bundle loading
- Multi threading and multi processing

It is destined to build my personnal virtual assistant, and it is designed for large app or API server, but very not recommended for website (use Symfony for web is more simple).

If you want to try this, you need to use the skeleton : [NitroPHP - Skeleton](https://github.com/PlumeSolution/NitroPHP-Skeleton)

If you have any suggestion or issue, contact me or open issue :wink:
